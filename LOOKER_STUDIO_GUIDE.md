## 🚀 Quick Start: Connecting Your Data

### Step 1: Connect BOTH Sheets to Looker Studio

#### Connect Invoices Sheet
1. **Open Your Google Sheet** with the invoice data
2. **Click** `Extensions` > `Looker Studio` > `Create`
3. Looker Studio will automatically open with your sheet as the data source
4. **Alternative Method:**
   - Go to [lookerstudio.google.com](https://lookerstudio.google.com)
   - Click **Create** > **Data Source**
   - Select **Google Sheets**
   - Choose your Invoice Manager spreadsheet
   - Select the **Invoices** sheet
   - Click **Connect**

#### Connect Markups Sheet
1. In Looker Studio, click **Resource** > **Manage added data sources**
2. Click **Add a Data Source**
3. Select **Google Sheets**
4. Choose the same Invoice Manager spreadsheet
5. Select the **Markups** sheet
6. Click **Connect**

### Step 2: Configure Data Source Settings

#### Invoices Sheet - Field Configuration
| Field Name | Type | Aggregation |
|------------|------|-------------|
| ID | Text | None |
| Invoice Number | Text | None |
| Invoice Date | Date (YYYYMMDD) | None |
| Vendor | Text | None |
| Flower Cost | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Botanicals Cost | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Supplies Cost | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Greens Cost | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Miscellaneous Cost | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Invoice Credits | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Total Due | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Status | Text | None |
| Created Timestamp | Date & Time | None |
| Last Modified Timestamp | Date & Time | None |
| Created By | Text | None |
| Last Modified By | Text | None |

#### Markups Sheet - Field Configuration
| Field Name | Type | Aggregation |
|------------|------|-------------|
| ID | Text | None |
| Effective Date | Date (YYYYMMDD) | None |
| Flowers Markup | Number | None |
| Botanicals Markup | Number | None |
| Supplies Markup | Number | None |
| Greens Markup | Number | None |
| Miscellaneous Markup | Number | None |
| Created Timestamp | Date & Time | None |
| Last Modified Timestamp | Date & Time | None |
| Created By | Text | None |
| Last Modified By | Text | None |

**CRITICAL:** The **Effective Date** field indicates when each set of markups became active. This allows historical markup tracking so invoices use the correct markup values that were in effect at the time.

### Step 3: Create a Blended Data Source with Dynamic Date Matching

Looker Studio doesn't support complex SQL-style joins with inequality operators (like "find the most recent date ≤ invoice date") directly in the blend interface. However, we can use a **workaround with Google Sheets formulas** to handle this dynamically.

#### Option A: Dynamic Approach Using Google Sheets (RECOMMENDED)

This approach requires no manual updates to Looker Studio when markups change - everything updates automatically!

**In Your Google Sheets - Add Columns to Invoices Sheet:**

1. **Open your Invoices sheet** in Google Sheets
2. **Add a new column** called `Applicable Markup Date` (next to your existing columns)
3. **In the first data row** (assuming headers are in row 1, this would be row 2), enter this formula:

```
=MAXIFS(Markups!$B:$B, Markups!$B:$B, "<="&A2)
```

**Where:**
- `Markups!$B:$B` is the Effective Date column in your Markups sheet
- `A2` is the Invoice Date in the current row
- This formula finds the most recent markup effective date that is ≤ the invoice date

4. **Drag the formula down** to fill all rows in your Invoices sheet
5. **Format the column** as a Date (Format → Number → Date)

**Example:**
```
Row 2: Invoice Date = 2025-03-15
       Formula finds: MAX(2025-01-01) where dates ≤ 2025-03-15
       Result: 2025-01-01

Row 3: Invoice Date = 2025-12-01
       Formula finds: MAX(2025-01-01, 2025-11-01) where dates ≤ 2025-12-01
       Result: 2025-11-01
```

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- ✅ **Fully automatic** - When you add a new markup row with a new effective date, the formulas automatically recalculate
- ✅ **No Looker Studio updates needed** - The Applicable Markup Date column updates in Google Sheets, and Looker Studio just reads it
- ✅ **Works for all invoices** - Past, present, and future invoices automatically get the correct markup date
- ✅ **Easy to verify** - You can see the applied markup date right in your spreadsheet

6. **Verify it's working**: Add a test row to your Markups sheet with a future effective date and watch the Applicable Markup Date column update for future invoices

**In Looker Studio:**

1. **Refresh your Invoices data source** (Resource → Manage added data sources → Invoices → Refresh fields)
2. The new `Applicable Markup Date` column will now be available as a field
3. Ensure it's set as **Date** type

Now proceed to Step 4 to create the blend using this dynamic field!

---

#### Option B: Manual Calculated Field in Looker Studio (Not Recommended)

If you prefer to keep everything in Looker Studio without modifying your Google Sheet, you can create a calculated field, but it **requires manual updates** each time markups change:

**In Looker Studio - Invoices Data Source:**

1. Go to **Resource** > **Manage added data sources**
2. Click on your **Invoices** data source
3. Click **Add a Field**
4. **Field Name:** `Applicable Markup Date`
5. **Formula:**

```
CASE
  WHEN Invoice Date >= DATE(2025, 11, 1) THEN DATE(2025, 11, 1)
  WHEN Invoice Date >= DATE(2025, 1, 1) THEN DATE(2025, 1, 1)
  ELSE DATE(2025, 1, 1)
END
```

6. Click **Save**

**⚠️ Limitation:** You must manually update this formula each time you add a new markup effective date to your Markups sheet.

---

**We strongly recommend Option A (Google Sheets formula)** for a fully automated, hands-off solution.

### Step 4: Create a Blended Data Source (CRITICAL for Profit Analysis with Historical Markup Tracking)

Now we'll create a blend that joins invoices to the correct markup row based on date.

#### Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open or Create a Report** in Looker Studio
   - Go to [lookerstudio.google.com](https://lookerstudio.google.com)
   - Either open an existing report or create a new blank report

2. **Access the Blend Data Function**
   - Method 1: In the toolbar, click **Resource** > **Manage added data sources** > **Blend Data** (bottom of the modal)
   - Method 2: While editing a chart, click the **Blend Data** button in the data panel
   - Method 3: From the main report menu, click **Add Data** > **Blend Data**

3. **Configure the Left Table (Invoices)**
   - In the blend editor, you'll see two tables side-by-side
   - **Left Table:** Select your **Invoices** data source from the dropdown
   - **Dimensions to Include:** 
     - Invoice Date
     - Invoice Number
     - Vendor
     - Flower Cost
     - Botanicals Cost
     - Supplies Cost
     - Greens Cost
     - Miscellaneous Cost
     - Invoice Credits
     - Total Due
     - Status
     - **Applicable Markup Date** (the column from Google Sheets or calculated field)
   - **Join Key:** Click **Add a join key** and select **Applicable Markup Date**

4. **Configure the Right Table (Markups)**
   - **Right Table:** Select your **Markups** data source from the dropdown
   - **Dimensions to Include:**
     - Effective Date
     - Flowers Markup
     - Botanicals Markup
     - Supplies Markup
     - Greens Markup
     - Miscellaneous Markup
   - **Join Key:** Click **Add a join key** and select **Effective Date**

5. **Set the Join Type**
   - In the middle between the two tables, you'll see the join configuration
   - Click on the join diagram
   - Select **Left Outer Join**
   - This ensures all invoices are included, even if there's no matching markup row (though there should always be one)

6. **Verify the Join Keys Match**
   - You should see a line connecting **Applicable Markup Date** (from Invoices) to **Effective Date** (from Markups)
   - This ensures each invoice gets the markup values from the row with a matching effective date

7. **Name Your Blended Data Source**
   - At the top of the blend editor, click on the default name (e.g., "Blend 1")
   - Rename it to: **"Invoices with Markups"**

8. **Save the Blend**
   - Click **Save** (top right)
   - You now have a blended data source that correctly matches each invoice to its historical markup values!

#### Visual Reference for Join Configuration:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────────┐
│   INVOICES (Left)       │         │   MARKUPS (Right)       │
├─────────────────────────┤         ├─────────────────────────┤
│ Invoice Date            │         │ Effective Date          │
│ Invoice Number          │         │ Flowers Markup          │
│ Vendor                  │         │ Botanicals Markup       │
│ Flower Cost             │         │ Supplies Markup         │
│ Total Due               │         │ Greens Markup           │
│ Applicable Markup Date ─┼────────▶│ Miscellaneous Markup    │
│   (calculated)          │  JOIN   │                         │
└─────────────────────────┘         └─────────────────────────┘
        LEFT OUTER JOIN
   (All invoices included, matched to correct markup by date)
```

#### How the Date-Based Join Works:

**Example Scenario:**
- Markups Sheet Row 1: Effective Date = Jan 1, 2025, Flowers Markup = 2.0x
- Markups Sheet Row 2: Effective Date = Nov 1, 2025, Flowers Markup = 2.5x

**Invoice Matching:**
- Invoice dated **March 15, 2025** → Applicable Markup Date = Jan 1, 2025 → Joins to Row 1 → Uses 2.0x markup
- Invoice dated **December 1, 2025** → Applicable Markup Date = Nov 1, 2025 → Joins to Row 2 → Uses 2.5x markup

This ensures **historical accuracy** - old invoices use old markups, new invoices use new markups!

### Step 5: Create Calculated Fields for Profit Analysis

Now you need to create calculated fields that will use the markup values from your blend. **IMPORTANT:** You cannot add calculated fields directly to a blended data source in Looker Studio. Instead, you'll create these fields when you add charts to your reports.

**How to Add Calculated Fields in Looker Studio:**

1. **Create a new report** or open an existing one
2. **Add a chart** (Scorecard, Table, Line Chart, etc.)
3. In the chart's **Data** panel on the right, you'll see the blended data source
4. Click **Add a field** (the "fx" button) at the bottom of the Metrics or Dimensions section
5. Create the calculated field with the formulas below
6. The field will be available for that chart

**Alternatively (Better for Reusability):**

1. While editing a chart that uses your "Invoices with Markups" blend
2. Click on the data source name at the top of the Data panel
3. Click **Edit Data Source**
4. This opens the data source editor
5. Click **Add a field** here
6. Fields created this way are available to all charts using this blend

**Note:** Once you create a field in a chart, you can reuse it across other charts in the same report by selecting it from the available fields list.

Below are the critical calculated field formulas you'll need. Create these as you build your reports:

#### Core Business Metrics

**1. Wholesale Cost (What We Pay Vendors)**
```
Total Due
```

**2. Retail - Flowers**
```
Flower Cost * Flowers Markup
```

**3. Wholesale - Botanicals**
```
Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup
```

**4. Wholesale - Supplies**
```
Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup
```

**5. Wholesale - Greens**
```
Greens Cost * Greens Markup
```

**6. Wholesale - Miscellaneous**
```
Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup
```

**7. Total Wholesale (What We Should Charge)**
```
(Flower Cost * Flowers Markup) + 
(Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup) + 
(Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup) + 
(Greens Cost * Greens Markup) + 
(Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup) - 
Invoice Credits
```

**8. Total Profit/Margin**
```
((Flower Cost * Flowers Markup) + 
(Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup) + 
(Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup) + 
(Greens Cost * Greens Markup) + 
(Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup) - 
Invoice Credits) - Total Due
```

**9. Profit Margin %**
```
CASE 
  WHEN Total Due = 0 THEN 0
  ELSE (((Flower Cost * Flowers Markup) + 
         (Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup) + 
         (Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup) + 
         (Greens Cost * Greens Markup) + 
         (Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup) - 
         Invoice Credits - Total Due) / 
        ((Flower Cost * Flowers Markup) + 
         (Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup) + 
         (Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup) + 
         (Greens Cost * Greens Markup) + 
         (Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup) - 
         Invoice Credits)) * 100
END
```

**10. Month-Year**
```
CONCAT(YEAR(Invoice Date), "-", FORMAT_DATE("%m", Invoice Date), " - ", FORMAT_DATE("%B", Invoice Date))
```

**11. Quarter**
```
CONCAT("Q", CAST(CEIL(MONTH(Invoice Date)/3) AS TEXT), " ", CAST(YEAR(Invoice Date) AS TEXT))
```

**12. Year**
```
YEAR(Invoice Date)
```

**13. Month Name**
```
FORMAT_DATE("%B", Invoice Date)
```

**14. Week of Year**
```
WEEK(Invoice Date)
```

**15. Day of Week**
```
FORMAT_DATE("%A", Invoice Date)
```

**16. Average Invoice Value (Wholesale)**
```
AVG(Total Due)
```

**17. Average Profit per Invoice**
```
AVG(Total Profit/Margin)
```

**18. Invoice Count**
```
COUNT(Invoice Number)
```

**19. Vendor Price Change Indicator** (Requires historical data)
```
(AVG(Total Due) - LAG(AVG(Total Due), 1)) / LAG(AVG(Total Due), 1) * 100
```

**20. Category Cost %**
```
(Flower Cost / Total Due) * 100
```

## 🎓 Implementation Checklist

### Week 1: Data Foundation & Critical Reports
- [ ] Add Markups sheet to your Google Sheet (if not already present)
- [ ] Add "Effective Date" column to Markups sheet
- [ ] Enter effective dates for each markup row (e.g., Jan 1, 2025, Nov 1, 2025)
- [ ] Ensure all historical markup changes have rows with effective dates

- [ ] Build Category Performance Analysis
- [ ] Configure all filter controls
- [ ] Add comparison periods (MoM, YoY)
- [ ] Apply brand colors and formatting
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness

### Week 3: Advanced Features & Deployment
- [ ] Build Invoice Detail Explorer

- [ ] Verify new invoices are automatically using updated markup values (Google Sheets formula handles this!)
- [ ] Optimize slow-loading charts
- [ ] Add new metrics based on business needs
- [ ] Archive unused reports

### When Markups Change - Maintenance Checklist (Fully Automated!)

Every time you update your markup multipliers:

#### If Using Option A (Google Sheets Formula - RECOMMENDED):

1. **Add New Row to Markups Sheet**
   - Add a new row to your Markups sheet with:
     - **Effective Date:** The date the new markups take effect (e.g., 2026-02-01)
     - **Markup values:** New multipliers for each category
   - Example:
     ```
     | Effective Date | Flowers Markup | Botanicals Markup | ... |
     | 2026-02-01     | 2.6           | 2.5              | ... |
     ```

2. **That's It! Everything Else Is Automatic**
   - ✅ The MAXIFS formula in the Invoices sheet automatically recalculates
   - ✅ New invoices on/after Feb 1, 2026 automatically use the new markups
   - ✅ Historical invoices continue using their original markups
   - ✅ Looker Studio reports automatically reflect the correct values
   - ✅ **No Looker Studio changes needed!**

3. **Verify (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Create a test invoice with today's date in Google Sheets
   - Check that the `Applicable Markup Date` column shows the correct effective date
   - View the invoice in your Looker Studio report
   - Verify it's using the new markup values in profit calculations

#### If Using Option B (Manual Looker Studio Calculated Field - NOT RECOMMENDED):

1. **Add New Row to Markups Sheet**
   - Add a new row with the new effective date and markup values

2. **Update the Looker Studio Calculated Field** ⚠️ (Manual Step Required)
   - In Looker Studio, go to **Resource** > **Manage added data sources**
   - Click on **Invoices** data source
   - Edit the **Applicable Markup Date** calculated field
   - Add a new CASE condition for the new effective date:
   ```
   CASE
     WHEN Invoice Date >= DATE(2026, 2, 1) THEN DATE(2026, 2, 1)
     WHEN Invoice Date >= DATE(2025, 11, 1) THEN DATE(2025, 11, 1)
     WHEN Invoice Date >= DATE(2025, 1, 1) THEN DATE(2025, 1, 1)
     ELSE DATE(2025, 1, 1)
   END
   ```
   - Always add new dates at the TOP of the CASE statement
   - Save the field

3. **Test the Update**
   - Create a test invoice with today's date
   - View it in your Looker Studio report
   - Verify it's using the new markup values

---

**💡 Pro Tip:** If you're currently using Option B and want to switch to the fully automated Option A:

1. Add the `Applicable Markup Date` column with the MAXIFS formula to your Invoices sheet
2. In Looker Studio, refresh your Invoices data source (Resource → Manage added data sources → Invoices → Refresh fields)
3. Edit your blend to use the new field from Google Sheets instead of the calculated field
4. Delete the old calculated field from Looker Studio
5. You're now fully automated!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Profit Analysis Best Practices
1. **Regular Markup Review** - Update Markups sheet monthly based on market conditions
2. **Historical Markup Tracking** - Consider adding "Effective Date" to Markups sheet for historical analysis
3. **Category-Specific Targets** - Set different margin targets for different categories
4. **Vendor Negotiation Tool** - Use price intelligence report before vendor negotiations
5. **Seasonal Markup Adjustment** - Consider different markups for busy vs. slow seasons

### Performance Optimization
1. **Use date range controls** - Default to last 12 months for fast loading
2. **Pre-aggregate data** - Create summary tables for large datasets
3. **Limit chart data** - Use TOP N filters (Top 10 vendors, etc.)
4. **Cached data** - Use data freshness of 1-4 hours (not real-time)
5. **Incremental refresh** - Only refresh new/changed data

### User Experience
1. **Add context** - Tooltips explaining what "good" looks like (e.g., "Target margin: 40%")
2. **Use comparisons** - Always show vs. previous period and vs. target
3. **Highlight insights** - Add text annotations explaining unusual patterns
4. **Mobile-first** - Test on phone/tablet before sharing
5. **Consistent navigation** - Add menu/tabs for easy report switching
6. **Color consistency** - Always use green for profit, red for loss

### Data Quality
1. **Validate markups** - Ensure markups in Markups sheet are correct (>1.0 for profit)
2. **Filter active invoices** - Exclude ARCHIVED status if needed
3. **Handle nulls** - Use IFNULL() and COALESCE() in calculated fields
4. **Verify calculations** - Spot-check profit calculations against manual calculations
5. **Document assumptions** - Add "About" page explaining how profit is calculated

## 📊 Sample Business Insights You'll Discover

With these reports in place, you'll be able to answer:

### Profitability Questions
- ✅ "Our overall margin is 35%, but Flowers category is only 28%. We need to increase Flowers markup from 2.0x to 2.3x to charge customers more."
- ✅ "Margin dropped from 38% to 32% in the last 2 months. Investigation shows Vendor ABC raised wholesale prices by 15%."
- ✅ "We're charging customers enough on Supplies (45% margin) but not enough on Greens (22% margin)."

### Vendor Intelligence
- ✅ "Vendor XYZ increased prices 12% in March. Time to negotiate or find alternatives."
- ✅ "We're spending 40% of our budget with one vendor - too much concentration risk."
- ✅ "Vendor ABC has the most volatile pricing (high std. deviation) - unreliable for planning."

### Seasonality Insights
- ✅ "May and December are consistently our busiest months (wedding + holiday season)."
- ✅ "January is always slow - consider promotional pricing to drive volume."
- ✅ "Last year we had an outlier spike in June due to a corporate event - that's not repeating this year."

### Category Performance
- ✅ "Flowers represent 60% of our wholesale costs but only 50% of our profit - we're over-reliant on this low-margin category."
- ✅ "Botanicals have the highest margin (48%) - we should promote these products more to customers."

## 🚨 Important Notes for Small Datasets

Since you mentioned not having significant data yet:

### Initial Setup (< 3 months data)
- ✅ Set up all reports now - they'll improve as data accumulates
- ✅ Focus on Executive Dashboard and Margin Analysis first
- ⚠️ Vendor price trends need at least 3-6 months to be meaningful
- ⚠️ Seasonality analysis requires at least 12 months (ideally 2+ years)
- ✅ Use this time to validate that calculations are correct

### Data Building Phase (3-6 months data)
- ✅ Month-over-month trends become meaningful
- ✅ Vendor price tracking starts to show patterns
- ✅ Category performance comparisons are reliable
- ⚠️ Seasonality still requires more data

### Mature Analytics (12+ months data)
- ✅ Year-over-year comparisons available
- ✅ Seasonality patterns clearly visible
- ✅ Predictive forecasting becomes accurate
- ✅ All reports fully functional

### What to Do NOW with Limited Data
1. **Set up the infrastructure** - Reports, calculated fields, dashboards
2. **Validate calculations** - Manually verify profit calculations are correct
3. **Monitor margin in real-time** - Even with little data, you can track if you're charging enough
4. **Use for invoice entry** - Review each new invoice against target margin
5. **Plan for the future** - Dashboards will auto-populate as you add data

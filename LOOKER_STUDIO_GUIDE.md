## 🚀 Quick Start: Connecting Your Data

### Step 1: Connect BOTH Sheets to Looker Studio

#### Connect Invoices Sheet
1. **Open Your Google Sheet** with the invoice data
2. **Click** `Extensions` > `Looker Studio` > `Create`
3. Looker Studio will automatically open with your sheet as the data source
4. **Alternative Method:**
   - Go to [lookerstudio.google.com](https://lookerstudio.google.com)
   - Click **Create** > **Data Source**
   - Select **Google Sheets**
   - Choose your Invoice Manager spreadsheet
   - Select the **Invoices** sheet
   - **Ensure "Use first row as headers" is checked.**
   - Click **Connect**

#### Connect Markups Sheet
1. In Looker Studio, click **Resource** > **Manage added data sources**
2. Click **Add a Data Source**
3. Select **Google Sheets**
4. Choose the same Invoice Manager spreadsheet
5. Select the **Markups** sheet
6. **Ensure "Use first row as headers" is checked.**
7. Click **Connect**

### Step 2: Configure Data Source Settings

#### Invoices Sheet - Field Configuration
| Field Name | Type | Aggregation |
|------------|------|-------------|
| ID | Text | None |
| Invoice Number | Text | None |
| Invoice Date | Date (YYYYMMDD) | None |
| Vendor | Text | None |
| Flower Cost | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Botanicals Cost | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Supplies Cost | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Greens Cost | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Miscellaneous Cost | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Invoice Credits | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Total Due | Currency (USD) | Sum |
| Status | Text | None |
| Created Timestamp | Date & Time | None |
| Last Modified Timestamp | Date & Time | None |
| Created By | Text | None |
| Last Modified By | Text | None |

#### Markups Sheet - Field Configuration
| Field Name | Type | Aggregation |
|------------|------|-------------|
| ID | Text | None |
| Effective Date | Date (YYYYMMDD) | None |
| Flowers Markup | Number | None |
| Botanicals Markup | Number | None |
| Supplies Markup | Number | None |
| Greens Markup | Number | None |
| Miscellaneous Markup | Number | None |
| Created Timestamp | Date & Time | None |
| Last Modified Timestamp | Date & Time | None |
| Created By | Text | None |
| Last Modified By | Text | None |

**CRITICAL:** The **Effective Date** field indicates when each set of markups became active. This allows historical markup tracking so invoices use the correct markup values that were in effect at the time.

### Step 3: Create a Blended Data Source with Dynamic Date Matching

Looker Studio doesn't support complex SQL-style joins with inequality operators (like "find the most recent date ≤ invoice date") directly in the blend interface. However, we can use a **workaround with Google Sheets formulas** to handle this dynamically.

#### Option A: Dynamic Approach Using Google Sheets (RECOMMENDED)

This approach requires no manual updates to Looker Studio when markups change - everything updates automatically!

**In Your Google Sheets - Add Columns to Invoices Sheet:**

1. **Open your Invoices sheet** in Google Sheets
2. **Add a new column** called `Applicable Markup Date` (next to your existing columns)
3. **In the first data row** (assuming headers are in row 1, this would be row 2), enter this formula:

```
=MAXIFS(Markups!$B$2:$B$1000, Markups!$B$2:$B$1000, "<="&A2)
```

**Where:**
- `Markups!$B$2:$B$1000` is the Effective Date column in your Markups sheet. Using a specific range like `$B$2:$B$1000` is more efficient than searching the entire column (`$B:$B`). Adjust `1000` as needed to ensure it's larger than your expected number of markup entries.
- `A2` is the Invoice Date in the current row.
- This formula finds the most recent markup effective date that is on or before the invoice date.

**💡 Pro Tip for Robustness:** If an invoice is dated *before* your first effective date, the formula will return `0` (which appears as `12/30/1899`) and the invoice won't be matched correctly. To prevent this, ensure your first `Effective Date` in the `Markups` sheet is earlier than your oldest invoice.

4. **Drag the formula down** to fill all rows in your Invoices sheet
5. **Format the column** as a Date (Format → Number → Date)

**Example:**
```
Row 2: Invoice Date = 2025-03-15
       Formula finds: MAX(2025-01-01) where dates ≤ 2025-03-15
       Result: 2025-01-01

Row 3: Invoice Date = 2025-12-01
       Formula finds: MAX(2025-01-01, 2025-11-01) where dates ≤ 2025-12-01
       Result: 2025-11-01
```

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- ✅ **Fully automatic** - When you add a new markup row with a new effective date, the formulas automatically recalculate
- ✅ **No Looker Studio updates needed** - The Applicable Markup Date column updates in Google Sheets, and Looker Studio just reads it
- ✅ **Works for all invoices** - Past, present, and future invoices automatically get the correct markup date
- ✅ **Easy to verify** - You can see the applied markup date right in your spreadsheet

6. **Verify it's working**: Add a test row to your Markups sheet with a future effective date and watch the Applicable Markup Date column update for future invoices

**In Looker Studio:**

1. **Refresh your Invoices data source** (Resource → Manage added data sources → Invoices → Refresh fields)
2. The new `Applicable Markup Date` column will now be available as a field
3. Ensure it's set as **Date** type

Now proceed to Step 4 to create the blend using this dynamic field!

---

#### Option B: Manual Calculated Field in Looker Studio (Not Recommended)

If you prefer to keep everything in Looker Studio without modifying your Google Sheet, you can create a calculated field, but it **requires manual updates** each time markups change:

**In Looker Studio - Invoices Data Source:**

1. Go to **Resource** > **Manage added data sources**
2. Click on your **Invoices** data source
3. Click **Add a Field**
4. **Field Name:** `Applicable Markup Date`
5. **Formula:**

```
CASE
  WHEN Invoice Date >= DATE(2025, 11, 1) THEN DATE(2025, 11, 1)
  WHEN Invoice Date >= DATE(2025, 1, 1) THEN DATE(2025, 1, 1)
  -- Fallback for any invoices dated before the first known markup period.
  -- This should be your earliest effective date.
  ELSE DATE(2025, 1, 1)
END
```

6. Click **Save**

**⚠️ Limitation:** You must manually update this formula each time you add a new markup effective date to your Markups sheet.

---

**We strongly recommend Option A (Google Sheets formula)** for a fully automated, hands-off solution.

### Step 4: Create a Blended Data Source (CRITICAL for Profit Analysis with Historical Markup Tracking)

Now we'll create a blend that joins invoices to the correct markup row based on date.

#### Detailed Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Open or Create a Report** in Looker Studio
   - Go to [lookerstudio.google.com](https://lookerstudio.google.com)
   - Either open an existing report or create a new blank report

2. **Access the Blend Data Function**
   - Method 1: In the toolbar, click **Resource** > **Manage added data sources** > **Blend Data** (bottom of the modal)
   - Method 2: While editing a chart, click the **Blend Data** button in the data panel
   - Method 3: From the main report menu, click **Add Data** > **Blend Data**

3. **Configure the Left Table (Invoices)**
   - In the blend editor, you'll see two tables side-by-side
   - **Left Table:** Select your **Invoices** data source from the dropdown
   - **Dimensions to Include:** All fields from the Invoices sheet are automatically available. You only need to add the join key.
   - **Join Key:** Click **Add a join key** and select **Applicable Markup Date**.

4. **Configure the Right Table (Markups)**
   - **Right Table:** Select your **Markups** data source from the dropdown
   - **Dimensions to Include:**
     - Effective Date
     - Flowers Markup
     - Botanicals Markup
     - Supplies Markup
     - Greens Markup
     - Miscellaneous Markup
   - **Join Key:** Click **Add a join key** and select **Effective Date**

5. **Set the Join Type**
   - In the middle between the two tables, you'll see the join configuration
   - Click on the join diagram
   - Select **Left Outer Join**
   - This ensures all invoices are included, even if there's no matching markup row (though there should always be one)

6. **Verify the Join Keys Match**
   - You should see a line connecting **Applicable Markup Date** (from Invoices) to **Effective Date** (from Markups)
   - This ensures each invoice gets the markup values from the row with a matching effective date

7. **Name Your Blended Data Source**
   - At the top of the blend editor, click on the default name (e.g., "Blend 1")
   - Rename it to: **"Invoices with Markups"**

8. **Save the Blend**
   - Click **Save** (top right)
   - You now have a blended data source that correctly matches each invoice to its historical markup values!

#### Visual Reference for Join Configuration:

```
┌─────────────────────────┐         ┌─────────────────────────┐
│   INVOICES (Left)       │         │   MARKUPS (Right)       │
├─────────────────────────┤         ├─────────────────────────┤
│ Invoice Date            │         │ Effective Date          │
│ Invoice Number          │         │ Flowers Markup          │
│ Vendor                  │         │ Botanicals Markup       │
│ Flower Cost             │         │ Supplies Markup         │
│ Total Due               │         │ Greens Markup           │
│ Applicable Markup Date ─┼────────▶│ Miscellaneous Markup    │
│   (calculated)          │  JOIN   │                         │
└─────────────────────────┘         └─────────────────────────┘
        LEFT OUTER JOIN
   (All invoices included, matched to correct markup by date)
```

#### How the Date-Based Join Works:

**Example Scenario:**
- Markups Sheet Row 1: Effective Date = Jan 1, 2025, Flowers Markup = 2.0x
- Markups Sheet Row 2: Effective Date = Nov 1, 2025, Flowers Markup = 2.5x

**Invoice Matching:**
- Invoice dated **March 15, 2025** → Applicable Markup Date = Jan 1, 2025 → Joins to Row 1 → Uses 2.0x markup
- Invoice dated **December 1, 2025** → Applicable Markup Date = Nov 1, 2025 → Joins to Row 2 → Uses 2.5x markup

This ensures **historical accuracy** - old invoices use old markups, new invoices use new markups!

### Step 5: Create Calculated Fields for Profit Analysis

**IMPORTANT:** Your calculated fields must be created in two different places. Due to a Looker Studio limitation, you **cannot** add new calculated fields directly to a *blended* data source.

-   Fields that only use data from a **single source** (e.g., `Invoices`) should be created in that original data source for reusability.
-   Fields that combine data from **both sources** (e.g., `Invoices` and `Markups`) **must be created at the chart level**.

#### Part A: Add Reusable Fields to the `Invoices` Data Source

First, let's add the fields that only depend on the `Invoices` data. Creating them here makes them reusable across any report that uses this data source.

1.  Go to **Resource** > **Manage added data sources**.
2.  Find your original **Invoices** data source and click **Edit**.
3.  In the data source editor, click **Add a Field** (top right).
4.  Enter the field name and formula for each field below.

**💡 Pro Tip: Naming Convention**
> As a best practice, consider prefixing your calculated fields with `c_` (e.g., `c_Year`, `c_Invoice_Count`). This makes them easy to find and identify.

**Fields to Add to `Invoices` Data Source:**

**1. c_Year**
```
YEAR(Invoice Date)
```

**2. c_Quarter**
```
QUARTER(Invoice Date)
```

**3. c_Month_Year**
*For sorting and displaying trends over time.*
```
FORMAT_DATETIME("%Y-%m", Invoice Date)
```

**4. c_Month_Name**
```
FORMAT_DATETIME("%B", Invoice Date)
```

**5. c_Week_of_Year**
```
WEEK(Invoice Date)
```

**6. c_Day_of_Week**
```
FORMAT_DATETIME("%A", Invoice Date)
```

**7. c_Invoice_Count**
```
COUNT(Invoice Number)
```

**8. c_Category_Cost_Percent_Flowers**
*Calculates the percentage of total cost for a specific category. Create one for each category.*
```
Flower Cost / Total Due
```
*(Repeat for Botanicals, Supplies, Greens, and Miscellaneous)*

---

#### Part B: Create Blend-Specific Fields in Your Charts

Now, for the core profit metrics that combine `Invoice` costs with `Markup` multipliers. **These CANNOT be created in the blend editor itself.** According to Looker Studio documentation:

> "When you're creating calculated fields in a table in the blend, the formula can only reference fields found in that table. To create a calculated field based on fields from different data sources, add those fields to their respective tables in the blend, then create a chart-specific calculated field."

**CRITICAL STEPS - You Must Do This In Order:**

**Step 1: First, add ALL base fields to your blend**

Before creating any calculated fields, you need to ensure all the base fields from both data sources are included in your blend:

1. **Edit your "Invoices with Markups" blend** (Resource → Manage blended data → Click EDIT on your blend)
2. **From the Invoices table (left side), ensure these fields are included:**
   - Invoice Date
   - Vendor
   - Flower Cost
   - Botanicals Cost
   - Supplies Cost
   - Greens Cost
   - Miscellaneous Cost
   - Invoice Credits
   - Total Due
   - Invoice Number (and any other fields you want to display)
3. **From the Markups table (right side), ensure these fields are included:**
   - Flowers Markup
   - Botanicals Markup
   - Supplies Markup
   - Greens Markup
   - Miscellaneous Markup
4. **Click SAVE** to save the blend

**Step 2: Create a chart using the blended data source**

1. Add a new chart to your report (e.g., a **Table** chart works best for building and testing)
2. For the chart's **Data Source**, select your **"Invoices with Markups"** blend
3. Add some basic dimensions (like Invoice Date, Vendor) to the chart so you can see the data

**Step 3: Now create chart-level calculated fields**

With ALL base fields available in the blend, you can now create calculated fields in the chart:

1. In the chart's **Data Panel** (right side), click **Add a metric**
2. At the bottom of the dropdown, click **CREATE FIELD**
3. Enter the field name and formula
4. Click **Save**
5. The field will be added to your chart

**Step-by-Step Workflow for Building Dependent Fields:**

Create fields in this order (since some depend on others):

**Round 1: Create base retail price fields**
- `c_Retail_Price_Flowers`
- `c_Retail_Price_Botanicals`
- `c_Retail_Price_Supplies`
- `c_Retail_Price_Greens`
- `c_Retail_Price_Misc`

**Round 2: Create fields that combine the base fields**
- `c_Wholesale_Cost`
- `c_Total_Retail_Price` (uses the 5 retail price fields above)
- `c_Final_Retail_Price` (uses c_Total_Retail_Price)

**Round 3: Create profit calculations**
- `c_Total_Profit` (uses c_Final_Retail_Price and c_Wholesale_Cost)
- `c_Profit_Margin_Percent` (uses c_Total_Profit and c_Final_Retail_Price)

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Referencing Fields in Chart-Level Calculated Fields**

When referencing fields in your chart-level calculated field formulas:

**For fields from your blend (original Google Sheets fields):**
- Reference them **exactly as they appear in the field list**
- Example: `Flower Cost`, `Flowers Markup`, `Invoice Credits`

**For other chart-level calculated fields you've already created:**
- You **cannot reference them** in Looker Studio chart-level calculated fields!
- According to the documentation: *"You can't reference other chart-specific calculated fields in your formula, even if those fields are defined in the same chart."*

**SOLUTION: Create Complete Formulas Using Only Base Fields**

Since you cannot reference other chart-level calculated fields, **each formula must be self-contained** and reference only the base fields from your blend (the fields that come directly from your Google Sheets).

**Core Business Metrics (Create at Chart Level):**

Create these calculated fields in your chart. Each formula references ONLY the base fields from the blend:

**1. c_Wholesale_Cost**
*This is the total cost from the vendor invoice.*
```
Total Due
```

**2. c_Total_Retail_Price**
*The total price after all markups are applied (before credits). This calculates all category retail prices in one formula.*
```
(Flower Cost * Flowers Markup) + (Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup) + (Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup) + (Greens Cost * Greens Markup) + (Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup)
```

**3. c_Final_Retail_Price**
*The final retail price after invoice-level credits are applied.*
```
(Flower Cost * Flowers Markup) + (Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup) + (Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup) + (Greens Cost * Greens Markup) + (Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup) - Invoice Credits
```

**4. c_Total_Profit**
*The difference between the final retail price and the wholesale cost.*
```
((Flower Cost * Flowers Markup) + (Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup) + (Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup) + (Greens Cost * Greens Markup) + (Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup) - Invoice Credits) - Total Due
```

**5. c_Profit_Margin_Percent**
*The percentage of profit relative to the final retail price. After creating, edit the field to set its type to `Numeric` > `Percent`.*
```
CASE
  WHEN ((Flower Cost * Flowers Markup) + (Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup) + (Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup) + (Greens Cost * Greens Markup) + (Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup) - Invoice Credits) = 0 THEN 0
  ELSE (((Flower Cost * Flowers Markup) + (Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup) + (Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup) + (Greens Cost * Greens Markup) + (Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup) - Invoice Credits) - Total Due) / ((Flower Cost * Flowers Markup) + (Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup) + (Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup) + (Greens Cost * Greens Markup) + (Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup) - Invoice Credits)
END
```

**Optional: Individual Category Retail Prices (if you want to display them separately)**

If you want to show retail prices by category in your charts, create these individual fields:

**c_Retail_Price_Flowers**
```
Flower Cost * Flowers Markup
```

**c_Retail_Price_Botanicals**
```
Botanicals Cost * Botanicals Markup
```

**c_Retail_Price_Supplies**
```
Supplies Cost * Supplies Markup
```

**c_Retail_Price_Greens**
```
Greens Cost * Greens Markup
```

**c_Retail_Price_Misc**
```
Miscellaneous Cost * Miscellaneous Markup
```

**⚠️ Important Notes:**
- These chart-level calculated fields only exist within the specific chart where you create them
- To reuse these fields in other charts, **copy the entire chart** (Ctrl+C) and **paste it** (Ctrl+V), then change the chart type and configuration as needed. This copies all the calculated fields with it.
- Alternatively, create all your calculated fields in one "master" table chart, then copy that chart whenever you need to create a new visualization
- Yes, the formulas are long and repetitive - this is a Looker Studio limitation for blended data sources

## 🎨 Design Best Practices

### Color Scheme (Brand Aligned)
```css
Primary: #ec4899 (Pink)
Secondary: #8b5cf6 (Purple)
Success/Profit: #10b981 (Green)
Warning: #f59e0b (Amber)
Danger/Loss: #ef4444 (Red)
Neutral: #6b7280 (Gray)
Wholesale Costs: #3b82f6 (Blue)
Retail Revenue: #10b981 (Green)
```

### Margin Health Color Coding
- **> 40%:** Dark Green (Excellent)
- **30-40%:** Green (Good)
- **20-30%:** Yellow (Warning)
- **10-20%:** Orange (Concern)
- **< 10%:** Red (Critical)

### Typography
- **Headers:** 24-32px, Bold
- **Subheaders:** 18-20px, Semi-bold
- **Body Text:** 12-14px, Regular
- **Scorecards:** 36-48px, Bold
- **Alert Text:** 14px, Bold, Red/Yellow

### Layout Guidelines
1. **Use a Report Theme** - To apply your color scheme and fonts consistently across all reports, create and apply a **Report Theme**. This is far more efficient than styling each chart manually.
2. Use **2-3 column grid** for desktop
3. **Mobile responsive:** Stack components vertically
4. **White space:** Minimum 16px padding between elements
5. **Filter controls:** Always at top, sticky if possible
6. **Alert scorecards:** Prominent placement (top of page)
7. **Logo placement:** Top left corner

## 🎓 Implementation Checklist

### Week 1: Data Foundation & Critical Reports
- [ ] Add Markups sheet to your Google Sheet (if not already present)
- [ ] Add "Effective Date" column to Markups sheet
- [ ] Enter effective dates for each markup row (e.g., Jan 1, 2025, Nov 1, 2025)
- [ ] Ensure all historical markup changes have rows with effective dates
- [ ] **CRITICAL:** Add "Applicable Markup Date" column to Invoices sheet with MAXIFS formula (see Step 3, Option A)
- [ ] Verify the formula is working: Check that invoices show correct effective dates
- [ ] Connect Invoices sheet to Looker Studio
- [ ] Connect Markups sheet to Looker Studio
- [ ] Refresh Invoices data source in Looker Studio to include new "Applicable Markup Date" field
- [ ] Create blended data source (Invoices + Markups) with date-based join

- [ ] Create all calculated fields (profit, margin, wholesale) in blended data source
- [ ] Test calculations with sample invoices from different date ranges
- [ ] Build Executive Performance Dashboard
- [ ] Build Margin Analysis Dashboard
- [ ] **Validate:** Ensure profit calculations are accurate and use correct historical markups

- [ ] Build Category Performance Analysis
- [ ] Configure all filter controls
- [ ] Add comparison periods (MoM, YoY)
- [ ] Apply brand colors and formatting
- [ ] Test mobile responsiveness

### Week 3: Advanced Features & Deployment
- [ ] Build Invoice Detail Explorer
- [ ] Build Alerts & Anomaly Detection
- [ ] Set up email scheduled reports:
  - Daily: Alert summary
  - Weekly: Margin analysis
  - Monthly: Full business review
- [ ] Create PDF export templates

- [ ] Verify new invoices are automatically using updated markup values (Google Sheets formula handles this!)
- [ ] Optimize slow-loading charts
- [ ] Add new metrics based on business needs
- [ ] Archive unused reports

### When Markups Change - Maintenance Checklist (Fully Automated!)

Every time you update your markup multipliers:

#### If Using Option A (Google Sheets Formula - RECOMMENDED):

1. **Add New Row to Markups Sheet**
   - Add a new row to your Markups sheet with:
     - **Effective Date:** The date the new markups take effect (e.g., 2026-02-01)
     - **Markup values:** New multipliers for each category
   - Example:
     ```
     | Effective Date | Flowers Markup | Botanicals Markup | ... |
     | 2026-02-01     | 2.6           | 2.5              | ... |
     ```

2. **That's It! Everything Else Is Automatic**
   - ✅ The MAXIFS formula in the Invoices sheet automatically recalculates
   - ✅ New invoices on/after Feb 1, 2026 automatically use the new markups
   - ✅ Historical invoices continue using their original markups
   - ✅ Looker Studio reports automatically reflect the correct values
   - ✅ **No Looker Studio changes needed!**

3. **Verify (Optional but Recommended)**
   - Create a test invoice with today's date in Google Sheets
   - Check that the `Applicable Markup Date` column shows the correct effective date
   - View the invoice in your Looker Studio report
   - Verify it's using the new markup values in profit calculations

#### If Using Option B (Manual Looker Studio Calculated Field - NOT RECOMMENDED):

1. **Add New Row to Markups Sheet**
   - Add a new row with the new effective date and markup values

2. **Update the Looker Studio Calculated Field** ⚠️ (Manual Step Required)
   - In Looker Studio, go to **Resource** > **Manage added data sources**
   - Click on **Invoices** data source
   - Edit the **Applicable Markup Date** calculated field
   - Add a new CASE condition for the new effective date:
   ```
   CASE
     WHEN Invoice Date >= DATE(2026, 2, 1) THEN DATE(2026, 2, 1)
     WHEN Invoice Date >= DATE(2025, 11, 1) THEN DATE(2025, 11, 1)
     WHEN Invoice Date >= DATE(2025, 1, 1) THEN DATE(2025, 1, 1)
     ELSE DATE(2025, 1, 1)
   END
   ```
   - Always add new dates at the TOP of the CASE statement
   - Save the field

3. **Test the Update**
   - Create a test invoice with today's date
   - View it in your Looker Studio report
   - Verify it's using the new markup values

---

**💡 Pro Tip:** If you're currently using Option B and want to switch to the fully automated Option A:

1. Add the `Applicable Markup Date` column with the MAXIFS formula to your Invoices sheet
2. In Looker Studio, refresh your Invoices data source (Resource → Manage added data sources → Invoices → Refresh fields)
3. Edit your blend to use the new field from Google Sheets instead of the calculated field
4. Delete the old calculated field from Looker Studio
5. You're now fully automated!

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Profit Analysis Best Practices
1. **Regular Markup Review** - Update Markups sheet monthly based on market conditions
2. **Historical Markup Tracking** - Consider adding "Effective Date" to Markups sheet for historical analysis
3. **Category-Specific Targets** - Set different margin targets for different categories
4. **Vendor Negotiation Tool** - Use price intelligence report before vendor negotiations
5. **Seasonal Markup Adjustment** - Consider different markups for busy vs. slow seasons

### Performance Optimization
1. **Use date range controls** - Default to last 12 months for fast loading
2. **Pre-aggregate data** - Create summary tables for large datasets
3. **Limit chart data** - Use TOP N filters (Top 10 vendors, etc.)
4. **Cached data** - Use data freshness of 1-4 hours (not real-time)
5. **Incremental refresh** - Only refresh new/changed data

### User Experience
1. **Add context** - Tooltips explaining what "good" looks like (e.g., "Target margin: 40%")
2. **Use comparisons** - Always show vs. previous period and vs. target
3. **Highlight insights** - Add text annotations explaining unusual patterns
4. **Mobile-first** - Test on phone/tablet before sharing
5. **Consistent navigation** - Add menu/tabs for easy report switching
6. **Color consistency** - Always use green for profit, red for loss

### Data Quality
1. **Prevent Bad Data Entry** - In your `Markups` sheet, use **Data > Data validation** to ensure markup columns only accept numbers greater than 1. This prevents errors like typing "2x" instead of "2".
2. **Validate markups** - Ensure markups in Markups sheet are correct (>1.0 for profit)
3. **Filter active invoices** - Exclude ARCHIVED status if needed
4. **Handle nulls** - Use IFNULL() and COALESCE() in calculated fields
5. **Verify calculations** - Spot-check profit calculations against manual calculations
6. **Document assumptions** - Add "About" page explaining how profit is calculated

## 📊 Sample Business Insights You'll Discover

With these reports in place, you'll be able to answer:

### Profitability Questions

- ✅ "Margin dropped from 38% to 32% in the last 2 months. Investigation shows Vendor ABC raised wholesale prices by 15%."
- ✅ "We're charging customers enough on Supplies (45% margin) but not enough on Greens (22% margin)."

### Vendor Intelligence
- ✅ "Vendor XYZ increased prices 12% in March. Time to negotiate or find alternatives."

## 🚨 Important Notes for Small Datasets

Since you mentioned not having significant data yet:

### Initial Setup (< 3 months data)
- ✅ Set up all reports now - they'll improve as data accumulates
- ✅ Focus on Executive Dashboard and Margin Analysis first
- ⚠️ Vendor price trends need at least 3-6 months to be meaningful
- ⚠️ Seasonality analysis requires at least 12 months (ideally 2+ years)
- ✅ Use this time to validate that calculations are correct

### Data Building Phase (3-6 months data)
- ✅ Month-over-month trends become meaningful
- ✅ Vendor price tracking starts to show patterns
- ✅ Category performance comparisons are reliable
- ⚠️ Seasonality still requires more data

### Mature Analytics (12+ months data)
- ✅ Year-over-year comparisons available
- ✅ Seasonality patterns clearly visible
- ✅ Predictive forecasting becomes accurate
- ✅ All reports fully functional

### What to Do NOW with Limited Data
1. **Set up the infrastructure** - Reports, calculated fields, dashboards
2. **Validate calculations** - Manually verify profit calculations are correct
3. **Monitor margin in real-time** - Even with little data, you can track if you're charging enough
4. **Use for invoice entry** - Review each new invoice against target margin
5. **Plan for the future** - Dashboards will auto-populate as you add data
